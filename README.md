# GreenBotSG

GreenBotSG is an informative recycling bot that answers queries on recycling. Try it [now](https://t.me/green_sg_bot)!

## Motivation
We felt that a big reason why Singapore's recycling rate is low is that there was a lack of awareness on what items could be recycled and where they could find e-waste recycling bins. Hence, we wanted to create an information Telegram bot to solve this problem. The bot helps to make recycling easier as users can simply send messages to the bot to find out whether their item is suitable for recycling and whether they can throw it into the recycling blue bins. For e-waste that are only collected at special e-waste collection bins, the bot helps users to find the nearest collection points, making it more accessible and convenient. Our bot provides a solution for more convenient recycling where information is readily accessible with minimal user action.

## Features
The **GreenSGBot** aims to provide convenience in finding out recycling information. Here are its 3 main commands!
1. /info : takes in user input and informs them if an item is recyclable
2. /searchbin : informs users of nearby e-waste bins by requesting user's location 
3. /postalcodesearchbin : finds the nearest e-waste bins based on the postal code sent by the user. 

The information command takes in various types of input and provides suggestions when the user's input is too generic so that they do not have to follow a strict input. The e-waste commands also include information on what type of e-waste can be recycled for the particular e-waste bin so that users do not have to make a wasted trip :)
